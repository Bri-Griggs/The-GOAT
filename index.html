      <p> S'more's journey into our lives started way back in the year 2015.
        Nathan and I had unfortunately lost our first cat Winston and we had finally decided that we were ready to
        try adopting again for our one year anniversary. Nathan and I had visited the local shelter but we just
        didn't find one that clicked with us. A mutual friend of ours posted that she was fostering some kittens for
        a local cat
        shelter called 9 lives Cat Rescue with some adorable pictures of the kittens. There were multiple kittens
        and one of them
        was a fluffy white one named Mozart. He obviously had his name changed upon adoption because he felt more
        like a S'more than a Mozart.
      </p>

      <p> S'more is an amazing cat. He is fluffy, elegant, loving, and very kind.
        He misses us so much when we are away that he will be the first one to furn up and greet us when we return.
        He loves to be asked to be picked up by reaching up for you to grab him. He always makes sure to place his
        face on my face while I sleep so that he may keep me warm and watch over me. S'more gets excited to wear
        costumes that he will purr very loudly when he is in one. When I wake up in the morning, he is there to
        rub his face on me to wake me up and purr happily that I am awake. He loves to go for walks in the park
        in his stroller or in
        his back pack and he will let you know when he wants to go. I have never had a cat quite like him. He is
        also <a href="https://americasfavpet.com/2024/s-more-25ee">currently competing
